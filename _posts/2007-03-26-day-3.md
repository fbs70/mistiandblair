On Monday we started the day picking up our [San Francisco Go Card](http://www.gosanfranciscocard.com/ "http://www.gosanfranciscocard.com/") from the [Red and White Cruise box office](http://www.redandwhite.com/ "http://www.redandwhite.com/"). We then took the a ferry cruise around San Francisco Bay. From the tour we saw the marina, went under the Golden Gate Bridge, past Angel Island and around Alcatraz.

After the ferry cruise we decided to goto the [Exploratorium](http://www.exploratorium.edu/ "http://www.exploratorium.edu/") on the outskirts of the Presidio. On our way the weather went from overcast and chilly to chilly and rainy. We made it to the [Exploratorium](http://www.exploratorium.edu/ "http://www.exploratorium.edu/"), but I forgot to find out the hours of operation and of course it was closed.

So Misti was able to hired a taxi to take us to the Haight Ashbury area. We walked around and visited numerous shops while we were there. We then hailed another taxi to return us to Fishermanâ€™s Wharf.
