On Wednesday we took a Napa Valley/Sonoma Valley wine tasting tour.  The tour started from Fisherman’s Wharf and we traveled east passing [AT&T Park](http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/sf/ballpark/giantsenterprises/index.html "AT&T Park") home of the [San Francisco Giants](http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=sf "http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=sf"). The tour proceeded to take the [San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco-Oakland_Bay_Bridge "San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge") to get to the east bay area to head up to Napa Valley.

We were taken to 3 wineries in the area.

  * [Kirkland Ranch Winery](http://www.kirklandranchwinery.com/ "Kirkland Ranch Winery/")
  * [Madonna Estate Winery](http://www.madonnaestate.com/home.html "Madonna Estate Winery")
  * [Viansa Winery](http://www.viansa.com/ "Viansa Winery")

The tour finished by going over the [Golden Gate Bridge](http://www.goldengatebridge.org/ "http://www.goldengatebridge.org/") then returning us to Fisherman’s Wharf.
