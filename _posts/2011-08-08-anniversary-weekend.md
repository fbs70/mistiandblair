Last weekend we celebrated our 2nd anniversary. We went to <a href="www.violetcrowncinema.com/ " title="Violet Crown Cinema" target="_blank">Violet Crown Cinema</a> to see the documentary <a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/beatsrhymesandlife/" title="Beats Rhymes &#038; Life: The Travels of a Tribe Called Quest" target="_blank">Beats Rhyme & Life: The Travels of a Tribe Called Quest</a>. It was a very good movie. Then we went to Zed&#8217;s in north Austin for dinner. We capped off the night by having some anniversary cake.
