Our last day we got a late start but it was nice to sleep in. We walked around the North Beach area and took a set of stairs that went to [Coit Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coit_Tower "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coit_Tower").  From [Coit Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coit_Tower "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coit_Tower") you got a great view of the whole city. We walked down Lombard Street and ran into [Tattoo City](http://www.tattoocitysf.com/ "http://www.tattoocitysf.com/"), which is a tattoo shop that Ed Hardy started. We also found this really cool hat shop called [Goorin](http://www.goorin.com/ "http://www.goorin.com/"). This are some of the hats that Misti and I purchased.

We finished our day by having lunch at a really cool Italian restaurant.

At 5:30pm we caught an airport shuttle which took us and 4 other passengers to San Francisco International Airport.
