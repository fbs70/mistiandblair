Our first official day in San Francisco we started the day by eating breakfast at [Ihop](http://ihop.know-where.com/ihop/cgi/site?site=01762&address= "http://ihop.know-where.com/ihop/cgi/site?site=01762&address="), 1 block from our hotel. The day was a little over cast and cold, especially for 2 people from Phoenix, AZ. We walked down Beach St and passed in front of [Ghirardelli Square](http://www.ghirardellisq.com/ghirardellisq/ "http://www.ghirardellisq.com/ghirardellisq/"). When then headed south on Hyde Street and passed by the top of the famous Lombard Street. We continued on Hyde Street until we reached Broadway and headed east towards Chinatown. We continued to walked Broadway then north on Battery and ran into the [Levi Strauss](http://www.levistrauss.com/ "http://www.levistrauss.com/") building.
