Last weekend we celebrated our 2nd anniversary. We went to [Violet Crown Cinema](http://www.violetcrowncinema.com/){:target="_blank"} to see the documentary [Beats Rhyme & Life: The Travels of a Tribe Called Quest](http://www.sonyclassics.com/beatsrhymesandlife/){:target="_blank"}. It was a very good movie. Then we went to [Zedâ€™s](http://www.zeds.bz/){:target="_blank"} in north Austin for dinner. We capped off the night by having some anniversary cake.
