On Tuesday we started our day by going to The Wax Museum at Fisherman’s Wharf. Some of the wax figured looked like the real person but one some then color seemed to be a bit off.

We then walked down to the Powell-Hyde [Cable Car](http://www.sfcablecar.com/ "http://www.sfcablecar.com/") turnaround at Aquatic Park near Ghiradelli Square to take the cable car shopping.  The cable car took us up Russian and Nob hills before ending at the Powell Market turnaround.

The shopping in San Francisco is a shoppers dream. They have stores like [Bloomingdales](http://www1.bloomingdales.com/store/index.ognc?action=STORE_DETAIL&lstRegion=all&storeId=110039&x=17&y=4 "Bloomingdales"), [Niketown](http://niketown.nike.com/niketown/info/locator.jsp#niketownca "Niketown"), [Levi’s Store](http://www.levisstore.com/corp/index.jsp?page=storeLocator&locationCode=6&state=CA&city=San+Francisco&locName=San+Francisco "http://www.levisstore.com/corp/index.jsp?page=storeLocator&locationCode=6&state=CA&city=San+Francisco&locName=San+Francisco"), [Macy’s](http://www1.macys.com/store/event/index.ognc?action=search&storeId=212 "http://www1.macys.com/store/event/index.ognc?action=search&storeId=212") with a seperate mens’ shop, they are building a [Barneys New York](http://www.barneys.com/b/ "http://www.barneys.com/b/"), [Adidas](http://www.adidas.com/us/shared/home.asp "http://www.adidas.com/us/shared/home.asp") store and a [Puma](http://www.puma.com/pindex.jsp "http://www.puma.com/pindex.jsp") store just to name a few.

Before heading back to the Fisherman’s Wharf Area, we ate lunch at [Lori’s Diner](http://www.lorisdiner.com/home.html "http://www.lorisdiner.com/home.html"). We returned to Fisherman’s Wharf one the Powell-Mason [Cable Car](http://www.sfcablecar.com/ "http://www.sfcablecar.com/") line that begins at the Powell/ Market turntable, and the line runs from there up and over Nob Hill and down to Bay Street at Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf.
